Muzilla is a music NFT marketplace and streaming platform. It is like a decentralized version of Spotify, with a special touch of blockchain added on top. 
The blockchain aspect of this project is the standout feature. One can claim ownership of a track or an album. Artists will soon be able to sell special edition 
and exclusive edition albums, tracks and collectibles. The team kept the fundamentals and the soul of web3 alive by focussing on decentralization of data. We believe 
in empowering the ones who use our platform, ie. the artists and the listeners. Made with love, hard-work and ERC1155
